                <p>
                    I work to build a world where people age healthily, and then die suddenly, peacefully,
                    at a very old age. I do this through my general research theme, where I build expert-centered
                    interpretable AI methods and interactive platforms to enable more effective human-in-the-loop
                    <em>in-silico</em> hypothesis testing and downstream decision-making in biomedical and clinical
                    settings. I build these tools by contributing to the data generation or aggregation process,
                    followed by integrating omic, clinical, and environmental data, an essential combination often
                    missing from current therapeutic practice.

                    underrepresented groups in science, particularly computer science.
