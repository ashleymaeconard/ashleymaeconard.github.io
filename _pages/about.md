I am a Senior Researcher at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) [Health Futures](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-health-futures/) in [Cambridge, MA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/) working on building models for [rare disease diagnosis](https://www.broadinstitute.org/news/broad-institute-and-microsoft-collaborate-help-accelerate-disease-research-scalable-analytical) with the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/). My general research theme is to build expert-centered interpretable methods and platforms to enable more effective decision-making in biomedical and clinical settings. After all, I believe for methods to be useful, they must be used.

Please find my biography on [my Microsoft page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ashleyconard/), and connect with me on LinkedIn (left). You can find my [curriculum vitae](https://github.com/ashleymaeconard/ashleymaeconard.github.io/raw/master/files/cv_conard.pdf) and my [resume](https://github.com/ashleymaeconard/ashleymaeconard.github.io/raw/master/files/resume_conard.pdf) here.

I am updating my site. Stay tuned!



<!-- Previously, I was a post-doc in [Biostatistics](https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/biostats/home) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) working with [Dr. Lorin Crawford](http://www.lcrawlab.com/home.html). My research focused on building interpretable methods (statistical and Bayesian), tools, and associated platforms which integrate temporal (i.e. time-series) and multi-omics data to study gene regulation in development and disease. I have expertise working on small and imbalanced data problems in fruit fly and human, across the domains of cancer, neuroscience, and development. I believe that platforms should be accessible to provide causal mechanisms on user-friendly platforms that scale, thereby enabling non-coding researchers to develop accurate follow-up experimentation and diagnostics. I received my Ph.D. in [Computer Science](https://cs.brown.edu/) and [Computational Biology](https://ccmb.brown.edu/) from Brown. I did so in collaboration with my advisors [Dr. Erica Larschan](https://www.larschanlab.com/) (molecular biology), [Dr. Lorin Crawford](http://www.lcrawlab.com/home.html) (biostatistics), and [Dr. Charles Lawrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lawrence_(mathematician)) (applied math).  -->
