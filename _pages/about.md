I am a post-doc in [Biostatistics](https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/biostats/home) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) working with [Dr. Lorin Crawford](http://www.lcrawlab.com/home.html). I will be a Senior Researcher at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/) this fall. My research focuses on building interpretable methods (statistical and Bayesian), tools, and associated platforms which integrate temporal (i.e. time-series) and multi-omics data to study gene regulation in development and disease. I have expertise working on small and imbalanced data problems in fruit fly and human, across the domains of cancer, neuroscience, and development. I believe that platforms should be accessible to provide causal mechanisms on user-friendly platforms that scale, thereby enabling non-coding researchers to develop accurate follow-up experimentation and diagnostics. I received my Ph.D. in [Computer Science](https://cs.brown.edu/) and [Computational Biology](https://ccmb.brown.edu/) from Brown. I did so in collaboration with my advisors [Dr. Erica Larschan](https://www.larschanlab.com/) (molecular biology), [Dr. Lorin Crawford](http://www.lcrawlab.com/home.html) (biostatistics), and [Dr. Charles Lawrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lawrence_(mathematician)) (applied math).
