 I am a Computational Biology Ph.D. candidate and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at Brown University. My research focuses on building accessible time-series and multi-omics statistical and Bayesian inference methods to study gene regulation. I create visualization tools to enable other researchers to interpret the complex biology I model. I had a great 2021 summer working with the Biomedical Computing Team within Health Futures at Microsoft Research. I developed and co-developed 3 methods in areas of cancer, ALS, and Parkinson's. 
 
 During my Brown Masterâ€™s in Computer Science, I focused on modeling subclonal drivers in cancer and single-cell DNA copy-number mutations. At that time, I served on the Board of Trustees for the Anita Borg Institute and as Finance Chair for the ISCB Student Council. I was a 2015 Fulbright Research Scholar using game theory to identify protein binding preferences. I serve on the Board of Trustees for the Fulbright Association. I hold a Computer Science and Biochemistry degree from DePauw University, and spent my summers doing research projects at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Vanderbilt University, and Eli Lilly.
