I am a Computational Biology Ph.D. candidate and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at Brown University. My research focuses on building interpretable Bayesian and accessible statistical methods and visualizations which integrate temporal and multi-omics data to study gene regulation in development and disease. My highly reproducible visualizations and platforms enable researchers to interrogate complex biological data. I have expertise working on small and imbalanced data problems in fruit fly and human, across the domains of cancer, neuroscience, and development. I believe that to provide impactful genomic insights to users, we must show causal mechanisms and user-friendly visuals to enable accurate follow-up experimentation and diagnostics.

During my Master's in Computer Science at Brown and Princeton, I focused on modeling subclonal drivers in cancer. During that time, I served on the Board of Trustees for AnitaB.org and instituted several successful programs. I also served as ISCB Student Council Finance Chair, where I secured numerous continuing financial partnerships. I was a Fulbright Research Scholar using game theory to identify protein binding preferences, and subsequently served on the National Fulbright Association Board of Trustees. I hold a Computer Science and Biochemistry degree from DePauw University, and spent time outside of school doing research projects at Microsoft Research Health Futures, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Google, Vanderbilt University, Eli Lilly, Deloitte, and Phenome Health.

 I am currently finishing my Ph.D. while working part-time at with Phenome Health through Deloitte. I am their computational biologist working on data infrastructure and methods development. In Fall 2021 I had an apprentiship at Google Cloud working on multi-omic modeling, and in summer 2021 I worked with the Biomedical Computing Team within Health Futures at Microsoft Research. I developed and co-developed 3 methods in areas of cancer, ALS, and Parkinson's.
