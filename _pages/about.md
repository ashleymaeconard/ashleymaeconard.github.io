I am a Ph.D. in [Computer Science](https://cs.brown.edu/) and [Computational Biology](https://ccmb.brown.edu/) from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/). I will be joining [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/) candidate and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at Brown University. My research focused on building interpretable methods (statistical and Bayesian), tools, and associated platforms which integrate temporal (i.e. time-series) and multi-omics data to study gene regulation in development and disease. I did so under the supervision of my advisors [Dr. Erica Larschan](https://www.larschanlab.com/) (molecular biology), [Dr. Lorin Crawford](http://www.lcrawlab.com/home.html) (biostatistics), and [Dr. Charles Lawrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lawrence_(mathematician)) (applied math). My highly accessible platforms enable researchers to interrogate complex biological data. I have expertise working on small and imbalanced data problems in fruit fly and human, across the domains of cancer, neuroscience, and development. I believe that to provide impactful genomic insights to users, we must show causal mechanisms on user-friendly platforms that scale to enable accurate follow-up experimentation and diagnostics.
